## Things to check before printing

* Consider where to put your 
  * motor controllers,
  * power converters and
  * battery
* The not-in-line holes on the `BasePlate` are matching to a Raspberry Pi 3b

## Parts to print

* 1x BasePlate
* 2x Wheel
* 2x WheelMount

## Parts used in my build

* Raspberry Pi 3b
* Navio2 Board
* 2x BGMC from RoverTEC
* 2x BGM5208-200 brushless gimbal motors
* 3x Step-Down-Converter (to not overheat brushless gimbal motor controllers & brushless gimbal motors)
